# Repository created at Sep 20, 2024
# This should be treated like a logbook
# Whenever you pushed an edit, you should register it in this LogEntry.md 
# So that it would be easier to search for which area was edited
# For example:
# - Pushed at Sep 20, 11:54 am. 
#   - Edits in potions.java from line 54-78
# Also for good practice, always comment your code. What you did and what it does or what it is
# For example:
#   ///// Added new modifier to the invincibility potion 
#   ///// Palihug pa check ani if nay mali
#   // <Strength Potion>
