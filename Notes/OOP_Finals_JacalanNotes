         CHAPTER 1: THE CHOICE AND THE SEPARATION 
//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

In the mystical world of Erotoma, where balance between magic and life hangs by a thread, you stand at the Shrine of Beings, tasked with choosing one of several characters to lead a quest to save the world from looming destruction. Each character represents a powerful race tied to Erotoma's essence, but only one path can be chosen.

After your decision, chaos erupts. A freak accident occurs, splitting you from your companions and throwing you into a void. As you drift through this strange space, a Being—one of the last of its kind—appears before you, warning of a force known as **The Entity**, a malevolent power that threatens the entire world.

But before you can ask questions, the Being vanishes, and the world shatters. You wake up in a twisted version of Erotoma, alone, and with a gnawing sense of something not being right.

          CHAPTER 2: THE CORRUPTION OF A FORMER ALLY
//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

As you traverse the warped lands of Erotoma, which are now twisted by The Entity’s influence, you come across one of the characters you didn’t choose at the beginning of your journey. However, they are no longer the person you remember. Corrupted by The Entity, they now lead their once-noble race into darkness and ruin.

This former ally confronts you as the boss of this chapter. The fight is as much emotional as it is physical, filled with bitterness and accusations of betrayal. "You chose to abandon us!" they shout, their attacks infused with the dark power of The Entity. The battle becomes an inner conflict for you, as their words stir doubt within your heart.

After a fierce struggle, you manage to defeat them. But their final words echo ominously: “You are nothing but a pawn. You think you chose this path? You’re just following orders… like a puppet.” Their death leaves you with unsettling questions about your own purpose.

               CHAPTER 3: ANOTHER BETRAYED
//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

Pushing deeper into the corrupted world, you face yet another former ally—another character you didn’t select at the start. Like the first, they have fallen under the control of The Entity and lead their race into chaos.

The confrontation is intense. This boss accuses you of being complicit in The Entity’s rise, claiming that your choices were always manipulated. "You think you're the hero? You’re part of the problem! The Entity has you under its control!" they shout as the battle rages on.

You eventually defeat this boss, but their last words send a chill down your spine: “You don’t even know who you really are.” Doubt begins to creep in, and you start questioning your own identity and purpose.

//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
              CHAPTER 4: THE FINAL BATTLE
//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

You finally reach the core of the corrupted world, where The Entity awaits. But before you can face it, another figure emerges from the shadows—**your clone**. Except this time, it’s not just any clone. This figure claims to be **the real you**.

"You’re not the original," the clone says, a smirk on their face. "You’re just a copy. A reflection of what I once was, created during that accident. You’re the fake, sent to play out this twisted version of my life while I was trapped in the void. But now, I’m free."

Your heart sinks as the truth is revealed: during the freak accident in Chapter 1, you were separated from your true self. The clone you’ve been controlling this entire time is not the original, but a construct made by The Entity to carry out its plan. The real you was trapped in the void, watching as the clone—the version of you controlled by The Entity—fought through the corrupted world.

------------- PHASE 1: THE FIGHT WITH THE REAL YOU -------------

The battle begins, a confrontation against your true self. Every move they make feels eerily familiar, but they fight with a strength and clarity that you lack. As the real you attacks, they taunt you: "You’re nothing but a shadow, an illusion. I am the original, the real hero."

The fight is brutal, both physically and mentally, as you grapple with the truth of your existence. But through sheer willpower, you manage to defeat the real you, striking them down after an intense battle. As they fall, they smirk, whispering, "Even if you win this fight, you’re still not real. You’ll never be free."

Though victorious, the victory feels hollow, as you come to terms with the fact that you are not the original—just a copy created for The Entity’s dark purposes.

------------- PHASE 2: THE ENTITY’S WRATH -------------
 
With your clone defeated, The Entity itself emerges from the shadows, a monstrous force of pure corruption. The true final battle begins, but it quickly becomes apparent that no matter how hard you fight, you are outmatched. The Entity is not just an external force—it is part of you. Every time you land a blow, it feels like you are fighting against your own essence, and the weight of your existence bears down on you.

The Entity taunts you as you fight, saying, "You think defeating your original changes anything? You were made to serve me. Your life, your choices—they were never yours." 

Despite your best efforts, the battle is hopeless. The Entity's power is overwhelming, and slowly but surely, you are worn down, its dark energy seeping into you. No matter what you do, you cannot win. The truth that you were never meant to prevail sinks in, and you collapse in defeat, consumed by The Entity.

                        ENDINGS
//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

------------- The Forced Choice -------------
After your defeat, you are presented with two final choices:

= End it all
Overwhelmed by the revelation of your false existence, you can choose to end your life. This option leads to an immediate fade to black, bringing you back to the start menu as if your journey was nothing more than a fleeting dream. The game resets, and it’s as though your efforts never mattered.
  
= Atonement
Despite the hopelessness of your situation, you can choose to atone for your sins. A message appears, acknowledging the futility of your fight but praising your bravery for continuing to push forward. It tells you that while you may not be the real hero, your decision to keep going is an act of defiance against The Entity’s control. Upon restarting the game, small changes reflect your attempt to rebuild the world, but it remains shadowed by the weight of your failure.


------------- Secret Ending (unlocked by defeating The Entity) -------------

Though you are destined to lose the final battle, there is a secret ending that can be unlocked. If you somehow manage to defeat The Entity—an almost impossible feat requiring perfect strategy and a deep understanding of the game—you unlock the true ending.

In this alternate version of the battle, after you strike down The Entity, the corruption around you begins to fade. Instead of being consumed by darkness, you are bathed in light. The twisted world of Erotoma starts to restore itself, returning to its original beauty.

A mysterious figure appears before you, explaining the truth: "You were never meant to win. You were created by The Entity to perpetuate its cycle of destruction. But by breaking free and defeating it, you have shattered the chains that bind both yourself and this world."

The figure reveals that The Entity fed on the despair and chaos of the world, creating countless reflections of heroes to carry out its dark plans. By defeating it, you have broken the cycle, freeing both yourself and Erotoma from its corrupt influence.

The secret ending shows you standing over the restored world of Erotoma, not as a false reflection, but as a being who has broken free from The Entity’s control. The people begin to rebuild, and the land flourishes once more. Upon restarting the game, subtle changes show a world that is now free from The Entity’s grasp, with new characters and storylines reflecting the hope of a reborn Erotoma.
