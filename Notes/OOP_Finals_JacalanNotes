Chapter 1: The Choice and the Separation

Your journey begins in Erotoma, a world brimming with life and magic, but on the brink of destruction. As you stand before the ancient Shrine of Beings, you are tasked with choosing a character, each representing a race bound to the core of Erotoma's existence. Each race possesses a unique strength and history, yet only one path can be followed.

Suddenly, a freak accident tears through the shrine. You are violently separated from your party, thrown into a void. The last of The Beings—a cryptic and powerful entity—appears before you. Its voice is both soothing and ominous, speaking of a threat that exists beyond the stars, something called **The Entity**. "You are the chosen one," it says, though you feel a nagging sense of doubt.

Before you can respond, reality shatters around you, and you awaken in a twisted version of Erotoma—its beauty distorted, its skies darkened. You are alone.

Chapter 2: The Corruption of an Ally

Your journey through this warped world is fraught with danger. The lands are familiar, yet twisted into grotesque versions of what they once were. As you navigate this corrupted version of Erotoma, your path crosses with one of the characters you didn’t choose—the leader of a once proud race, now corrupted by The Entity's dark power.

This former ally is unrecognizable, their mind twisted and their soul bound to The Entity. Their race has followed them into madness, turning into dark versions of themselves. This character, once your friend, is now a boss who has embraced the darkness, blaming you for abandoning them when they needed you most.

The fight is personal, filled with accusations that gnaw at your conscience. "You chose your path, and you left me to rot in this darkness!" they cry as they strike with terrifying power. But it’s not just a battle of physical strength; they use their knowledge of your past against you, taunting you with your choices.

After a long and emotional battle, you defeat them, but their final words haunt you: "You were never the hero. You were always part of this. The Entity is not what you think..." Their defeat leaves a bitter taste in your mouth as you move deeper into the world.

Chapter 3: The Fall of Another

As you press on, you sense the influence of The Entity growing stronger, warping the very fabric of reality around you. Shadows whisper, and the landscape shifts, as if it’s alive. At the heart of this nightmare, you encounter another former ally—another character you didn’t choose. They stand before you, corrupted and twisted just like the first, now a servant of The Entity.

This boss fight is even more intense. The character you face speaks in riddles, telling you of a deeper plot that you have yet to fully understand. They accuse you of being part of the corruption itself, planting seeds of doubt. "You think you can save this world?" they mock, their voice filled with venom. "You’re no savior. You’re a puppet."

The battle is brutal, and each attack feels like a test of your resolve. As the fight drags on, you start to question your own motives—was your choice at the beginning truly yours? Or was it all orchestrated by something beyond your control?

When they fall, they reveal a dark truth: "We are not who we think we are. The Entity... it’s inside us all." Their words leave you shaken as you realize that your role in this conflict may be far more sinister than you ever imagined.

Chapter 4: The Mirror's Edge

The heart of the corruption lies ahead, where The Entity awaits. You reach the core of this twisted world, and there, you confront The Entity itself—a towering, incomprehensible force of darkness. But you are not alone.

Emerging from the shadows is a figure identical to you in every way. A perfect clone. The clone speaks, but the words come from your own mouth, chilling you to the core. "I am the real you. You are nothing but a reflection—an illusion created by The Entity. You are bound to lose."

The final battle begins, but it quickly becomes apparent that victory is impossible. The clone mimics your every move with flawless precision, while The Entity strikes from above with overwhelming power. Every time you land a blow, it feels as if you are fighting yourself, your own soul. 

No matter how hard you fight, no matter how many strikes you land, the outcome is inevitable. The Entity’s power is too great, and the clone knows your every move. As the battle reaches its climax, you begin to falter, and the clone seizes the opportunity. You fall to your knees as The Entity’s dark energy consumes you, revealing the final, horrible truth:

You were never meant to win. The accident that separated you from your party? It wasn’t an accident—it was a trap, designed by The Entity to split your soul, turning you into a puppet of its will. You were the villain all along, a reflection created to carry out The Entity’s dark plans.

The Forced Ending (the normal ending)

You are left with a choice that feels hollow:

End it all
- You can choose to end your own life, overwhelmed by the weight of the revelation. The screen fades to black, returning you to the start menu as if none of it mattered.

Atonement
- You can choose to atone for your sins, despite knowing that everything was orchestrated by The Entity. A message appears, acknowledging the futility of your actions but commending your bravery for pushing forward. The game subtly changes upon restart, but the world remains haunted by your failure.

Secret Ending (unlocked by defeating The Entity)

But what if you could fight fate itself?

If, through a series of precise actions and near-perfect strategies, you manage to **defeat The Entity**—a task that seems impossible—you unlock the secret ending. After defeating the clone and striking down The Entity, the world around you begins to dissolve. But instead of darkness, you are surrounded by light.

You awaken in a vast, ethereal landscape, where a mysterious figure stands before you. This figure explains that you have broken the cycle—a cycle of countless heroes doomed to fail, their souls twisted into puppets by The Entity’s will. You are the first to defeat it, and in doing so, you have shattered the chains binding reality.

"You were never supposed to win," the figure says. "But by doing so, you have revealed the truth." The Entity was not an outside force—it was a manifestation of the darkest parts of Erotoma itself, feeding on the despair and weakness of its people. By defeating it, you have freed the world, but the cost is high.

The secret ending shows you rebuilding Erotoma from the ashes, but this time, without the influence of The Entity. The world is no longer corrupted, and the once-lost races can finally begin to heal. The screen fades to white as you stand atop a mountain, looking out over the reborn land—a world that is now yours to shape, free from the darkness that once consumed it.

Upon restarting the game, subtle changes reflect your victory—hints of a world rebuilt, new characters, and a brighter, more hopeful future. But the journey is far from over, and new challenges await in this reimagined world of Erotoma.
